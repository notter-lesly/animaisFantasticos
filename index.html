            <h2>Fox</h2>
            <p>
              Foxes are small to medium-sized, omnivorous mammals belonging to several genera of the family Canidae. 
              
            </p>
            <p>
              Foxes have a flattened skull, upright triangular ears, a pointed, slightly upturned snout, 
              and a long bushy tail (or brush).
             
            </p>
            <p>
              Twelve species belong to the monophyletic "true foxes" group of genus Vulpes.
             
            </p>
            <p>
              The global distribution of foxes, together with their widespread reputation for cunning, 
              has contributed to their prominence in popular culture and folklore in many societies around the world.

            <h2>Squirrel</h2>
            <p>
              Squirrels are members of the family Sciuridae, a family that includes small or medium-size rodents. 
            </p>
            <p>
              The squirrel family includes tree squirrels, ground squirrels, chipmunks, marmots (including groundhogs), 
              flying squirrels, and prairie dogs amongst other rodents. 
            </p>
            <p>
              Squirrels are indigenous to the Americas, Eurasia, and Africa, and were introduced by humans to Australia.
               
            </p>
            <p>
              The earliest known fossilized squirrels date from the Eocene epoch, and among other living rodent families, 
              the squirrels are most closely related to the mountain beaver and to the dormice.

            <h2>Bear</h2>
            <p>
              Bears are carnivoran mammals of the family Ursidae. 
              Bears are found on the continents of North America, South America, Europe, and Asia. 
              
             </p>
            <p>
              Common characteristics of modern bears include large bodies with stocky legs, long snouts, small rounded ears
              shaggy hair, plantigrade paws with five nonretractile claws, and short tails.
                      
            </p>
            <p>
              With the exception of courting individuals and mothers with their young, bears are typically solitary animals. 
            </p>
            <p>
              They may be diurnal or nocturnal and have an excellent sense of smell. Despite their heavy build and awkward 
              gait, they are adept runners, climbers, and swimmers. Bears use shelters, such as caves and logs, as their dens;

            <h2>Wolf</h2>
            <p>
              The wolf is a large canine native to Eurasia and North America. 
              More than thirty subspecies of Canis lupus have been recognized
                            
            </p>
            <p>
              The wolf is the largest extant member of Canidae 
              The wolf is also distinguished from other Canis species by its less pointed ears and muzzle, 
              as well as a shorter torso and a longer tail.
            </p>
            <p>
              Of all members of the genus Canis, the wolf is most specialized for cooperative game hunting 
              as demonstrated by its physical adaptations to tackling large prey, its more social nature,
              and its highly advanced expressive behaviour.
            </p>
            <p>
              It travels in nuclear families consisting of a mated pair accompanied by their offspring

            <h2>Monkey</h2>
            <p>
              Monkey is a common name that may refer to groups or species of mammals, in part, the simians 
              of infraorder Simiiformes. The term is applied descriptively to groups of primates,
              such as families of New World monkeys and Old World monkeys.
            </p>
            <p>
              Many monkey species are tree-dwelling (arboreal), although there are species that live primarily on the ground, 
              such as baboons. Most species are also active during the day (diurnal). 
            </p>
            <p>
              Monkeys are generally considered to be intelligent, especially the Old World monkeys of Catarrhini.
            </p>
            <p>
              Monkeys, including apes, can be distinguished from other primates by having only two pectoral nipples,
              a pendulous penis, and a lack of sensory whiskers

            <h2>Lion</h2>
            <p>
              The lion (Panthera leo) is a species in the family Felidae and a member of the genus Panthera. 
              It has a muscular, deep-chested body, short, rounded head, round ears, and a hairy tuft at the end 
              of its tail.
            </p>
            <p>
              Groups of female lions usually hunt together, preying mostly on large ungulates. 
              The lion is an apex and keystone predator; although some lions scavenge when opportunities occur and have 
              been known to hunt humans, the species typically does not.
            </p>
            <p>
              Typically, the lion inhabits grasslands and savannas, but is absent in dense forests.
            </p>
            <p>
              It is usually more diurnal than other big cats, but when persecuted it adapts to being active at 
              night and at twilight

          <dt>what is an endangered species?</dt>
          <dd>
            An endangered species is a species that is very likely to become extinct in the near future, 
            either worldwide or in a particular political jurisdiction. 
            Endangered species may be at risk due to factors such as habitat loss, poaching and invasive species
          </dd>
          <dt>What has been done to protect wild life? </dt>
          <dd>
            The International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) Red List lists the global conservation status of
             many species, and various other agencies assess the status of species within particular areas. 
             Many nations have laws that protect conservation-reliant species which, for example, forbid hunting, 
             restrict land development, or create protected areas. Some endangered species are the target of extensive 
             conservation efforts such as captive breeding and habitat restoration.           
          </dd>
          <dt>How can I help?</dt>
          <dd>
            Volunteer. If you don’t have money to give, donate your time. 
            Many organizations and zoos have volunteer programs. You can help clean beaches, rescue wild animals 
            or teach visitor              
          </dd>
          <dt>And if I don't have time?</dt>
          <dd>
            Teach your friends and family about the wonderful wildlife, birds, fish and plants that live near you. 
            The first step to protecting endangered species is learning about how interesting and important they are.
